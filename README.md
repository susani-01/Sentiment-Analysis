# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Posts and Review
This project was developed during my internship at UneeQ to analyze the sentiment of social media posts and reviews using both traditional machine learning methods and state-of-the-art transformer models.

# Objective

To classify social media posts or user reviews based on sentiment ( positive, negative and neutral) using:

- Traditional ML models with TF-IDF features
- Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)
The goal was to evaluate which approach offers better accuracy, generalization, and contextual understanding.

# Models Used
Traditional Machine Learning (with TF-IDF):
Random Forest
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression

Transformer based model:
DistilBERT 

# Dataset 
I used dataset which was collected from twitter social media

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how transformer models like DistilBERT offer superior performance in sentiment analysis, capturing deeper context and subtle emotional cues from social media posts and user reviewsâ€”far beyond what traditional models can achieve.
